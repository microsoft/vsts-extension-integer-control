## Customize your work item form with a up/down control ##

Easily change your integer values with a up/down control on the work item form (ex. Hit Count for bugs). 

The control can be used by both your mouse and keyboard (up and down arrow keys).

## Quick steps to get started ##

> Please note: This extension is not yet supported on VSTS, as users cannot customize the control via VSTS UI. We will need to include steps on how to walk the user through this control for VSTS once there is support available. 

1. Navigate to your work item form and choose which field (integer) you would like to replace with the toggle control.

2. Learn about how to customize the up/down control directly on XML [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vsts-toggle-wit-custom-control/blob/master/README.md) for TFS. 

## Supported browsers ##

* Internet Explorer
* Microsoft Edge
* Google Chrome
